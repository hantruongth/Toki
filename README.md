Description of Task


Your task is to create an API to search over available flights. 
There are two available flight’s providers:
- https://obscure-caverns-79008.herokuapp.com/cheap 
- https://obscure-caverns-79008.herokuapp.com/business

Your API should aggregate return flights from both providers. Do remember about sorting, filtering and pagination.
Upload solution to any remote git repository like github, bitbucket etc.

Preferable technologies:
- Java 
- Spring boot 

Reminders/Tips:
- Remember about the tests - Write a readme file 
 - Optimize the application - Keep the code clean
 - Keep the commit naming strategy consistent 

PS:  Mocked API is deployed to free version of Heroku, so the first request can take a few more seconds
Good luck and have fun :)
